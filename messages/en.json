Our teachers follow the children’s interests to shape the units of inquiry. Each group of students is unique, with unique interests, and so while the units may vary from year to year, it follows a learning and development continuum based on Early Childhood standards.<br></br><br></br>Our Pre-K curriculum is based on the District of Columbia’s Common Core Early Learning Standards that define what preschool children should know and be able to do before they enter kindergarten. These Early Learning standards direct teachers’ instructional planning through developmentally appropriate guidelines that meet our children at their current developmental stage.<br></br><br></br>Early Childhood is a very specialized area within education, requiring very special teachers. All of our Pre-K teachers are certified and trained in Early Childhood education. Each grade level (Pre-K 2, 3, and 4) has a certified Early Childhood Special Educator on its team, as well as Instructional Assistants, nannies, and a dedicated janitorial and canteen team.",

Lessons are presented through hands-on demonstrations, purposeful visuals, and lots of singing. Students then choose and rotate through interest centers—role-play, writing, science exploration, light and shadows, and construction, to name a few. Our Pre-K children also attend specialist classes throughout the week including music, art, computers, library, physical education, and Thai. Students have a healthy snack in the morning and eat lunch in our separate canteen purposely built for our youngest students. The day ends with nap time in the classroom and an afternoon snack before returning home.",
