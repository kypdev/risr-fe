All elementary students are required to take Thai language and literacy, and our non-Thai students also learn about Thai culture.

A makeshift school officially opened on May 17 of that year—designated RIS Foundation Day—with four wooden classrooms behind Holy Redeemer Church. In 1963, what was then known as Ruam Rudi School (RRS) was officially chartered under the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs and renamed Ruamrudee International School (RIS). ",

Our Pre-K children also attend specialist classes throughout the week including music, art, computers, library, physical education, and Thai.
