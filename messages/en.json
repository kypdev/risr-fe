Across all grades, students have access to devices and lessons about the proper use of technology so teachers and students can safely use digital tools and resources in innovative and creative ways.

Our students are also introduced to skills and concepts in health and wellness. All elementary students are required to take Thai language and literacy, and our non-Thai students also learn about Thai culture. Collectively, these subjects not only offer elementary students a well-rounded school experience, but they help our children learn how to be considerate global citizens who are aware of the importance of caring about other people and our environment.<br></br><br></br>Our students’ social and emotional well-being is further supported by the Second Step curriculum. All of our teachers are skilled at adapting learning to individual student’s needs and meeting them where they are, developmentally. In all grades, we encourage students to make appropriate choices and exercise their independence, which promotes autonomy and a sense of safety—all of which are essential in developing well-adjusted, happy children who can focus on their learning.<br></br><br></br>The English Language Development Program (ELD) recognizes that one of the top priorities in a quality international education is the attainment of an academic-level of English fluency. English language learners are designated by their level of proficiency, from beginner to advanced, and each level requires matched instructional strategies to facilitate rapid skill development.<br></br><br></br>At RIS Ratchapruek, ELD students are immersed in a rich English-speaking environment and selectively enrolled in core mainstream subjects to give them frequent opportunities to interact with classmates and teachers. ELD students also get individualized support to accelerate their academic success.",

Push-in support gives English language learners help within mainstream classes.<br></br><br></br>RISR uses MAP NWEA and WIDA MODEL assessments to track progress in English language and academic skill development throughout the year, informing differentiation that supports each child's unique needs.",
